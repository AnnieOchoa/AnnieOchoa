## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Annie Ochoa
Software Development Studen at Kodigo

I am a dedicated software development student at Kodigo with a strong foundation in web development technologies. My skills include HTML and CSS for building user interfaces, a basic understanding of JavaScript for interactive web applications, and proficiency in using Bootstrap for responsive design. I'm familiar with Vite and have experience in using Figma for design work. Additionally, I have a foundational knowledge of SQL for database management. I work with development tools like Visual Studio Code and version control systems like Git and GitHub to collaborate and manage code effectively. I'm enthusiastic about expanding my skills and knowledge in the dynamic world of software development."

### About me ðŸ‘©
I am a Colombian professional with a background in social communication and journalism, which provided me with a solid foundation in effective communication and media literacy. However, my journey took an international turn when I resided abroad, affording me the opportunity to gain fluency in the English language and a deep understanding of diverse cultures. Over the course of several years, I have cultivated my professional expertise in the realm of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and customer service, where my strong communication skills and command of English have been pivotal in ensuring exceptional client and customer experiences.

My true passion, however, lies in the field of software development. Driven by a desire for excellence, I am dedicated to becoming a distinguished software developer. I have pursued my education through renowned platforms such as Udemy and Educaicion IT, and I am currently furthering my knowledge at Kodigo, where I am actively engaged in mastering the intricacies of this dynamic industry. What distinguishes me is an unwavering commitment to continuous learning, and I am known for my ability to apply my knowledge through the creation of practical, innovative mini-projects. In a world increasingly reliant on technology and software solutions, I am determined to become an agile and proficient developer capable of making a substantial impact.
